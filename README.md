# Rice-leaf-Disease-Prediction
Rice leaf disease prediction using CNN. 
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict rice leaf diseases, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy rate. By preprocessing the dataset with caching, prefetching, shuffling, and data augmentation, I've developed a robust model. This project aims to empower farmers with early detection tools to protect their crops, reduce yield loss, and enhance food security in the agricultural sector.
